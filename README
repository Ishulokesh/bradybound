Download speed Controller 
Helps You to save data 
Shape/limit the speed of your downloads. This is useful if you're on 3G
or LTE and don't want videos and songs to download fast, burning through
your data.

Few things to note:

 - This app requires a rooted phone.
 - Support depends on the ROM (ie not the phone).
 - The speed limit you set does not persist across reboots.
